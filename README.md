## Magic: The Generating
#### Author: Parker Griep

This is my final project for the class CS4120: Natural Language Processing at Northeastern University. In this project, I
built two language models (one GPT2 and one bidirectional, multi-layered LSTM) to generate Magic: The Gathering rules 
text.

You can walkthrough this project by interacting with the Google Colab.
